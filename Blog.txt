2024.02.20 Built on Sin
Insofar as Capitalism as an economic system makes use of profit as a motive, and maintains a free market, relying on the greed of the particpants to self regulate the market: then it is a system built on sin.

The diabolic influences in Capitalistic systems are fairly obvious, when considering it's typical progression towards centralization, preferential treatment for monoliths, and abject disregard for individuals and families.

In our present (2024, USA) situation, this diabolical influence can be seen clearly at work in large, multi-national corporations. 

However, as these entities are not families, and are not individuals, they cannot own property in accordance with the dictates of natural law. 

Therefore, it is impossible to steal from Walmart, or Amazon, or Google, since everything thev have, has no true owner, at least not yet.

Going back to natural law, it is not right to steal, unless something is owed to you in justice (in this case, meaning absolute necessity).

Thus we can look at something like the Landless Worker Movement, which cannot only be just, but spiritually salutary, as long as those with great need, are taking property that is legally owned by a corporation, as they cannot own it in actual fact.

It becomes an act of rectifying an evil. Property belonging to a No-one, becomes the property of a family based tribe.

But that highlights the problem: it is very difficult to appropriate property from the beloved son of the state. The state cares not whether itself, or large corporations, are legitimate or neutral, let alone good.

It is not easy to purge evil from our midst. It will require blood, sweat, and tears. But Christ leads the way, we will carry the cross of large corporations, and be crucified upon the hill of government.
