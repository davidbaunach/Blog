A place for long(ish) format writing.
Finished stuff will end up on my website, this is a place for drafts and stuff that's unfinished, but I think is still worth sharing.

2024.02.22
I have an idea for a character:

They have a smartphone, but they treat it like a joke.

It's never on.

They say: "let me show you this cool pic of a cat"

They pull out the phone, and a dry erase marker, and literally draw a picture of a cat on the dead screen of the phone.

They say: "let me play this cool new song for you"

And they pull out the phone, pretend to press some buttons, and just start singing.

They ask for your number, and again, just write it on the screen with the dry erase marker. Anyone who asks them for their number, just gets a random series of digits. Could be "1" could be "5841397453188452"

When they get bored in a conversation, they make a ringing noise, pull out the phone, look at it, and say "I really got to get this" then just put the phone back in their pocket and walk away.

They want to show you a video, they give the dead phone to you, and then just start to act out the video.

2024.02.20 Built on Sin
Insofar as Capitalism as an economic system makes use of profit as a motive, and maintains a free market, relying on the greed of the particpants to self regulate the market: then it is a system built on sin.

The diabolic influences in Capitalistic systems are fairly obvious, when considering it's typical progression towards centralization, preferential treatment for monoliths, and abject disregard for individuals and families.

In our present (2024, USA) situation, this diabolical influence can be seen clearly at work in large, multi-national corporations. 

However, as these entities are not families, and are not individuals, they cannot own property in accordance with the dictates of natural law. 

Therefore, it is impossible to steal from Walmart, or Amazon, or Google, since everything thev have, has no true owner, at least not yet.

Going back to natural law, it is not right to steal, unless something is owed to you in justice (in this case, meaning absolute necessity).

Thus we can look at something like the Landless Worker Movement, which cannot only be just, but spiritually salutary, as long as those with great need, are taking property that is legally owned by a corporation, as they cannot own it in actual fact.

It becomes an act of rectifying an evil. Property belonging to a No-one, becomes the property of a family based tribe.

But that highlights the problem: it is very difficult to appropriate property from the beloved son of the state. The state cares not whether itself, or large corporations, are legitimate or neutral, let alone good.

It is not easy to purge evil from our midst. It will require blood, sweat, and tears. But Christ leads the way, we will carry the cross of large corporations, and be crucified upon the hill of government.
