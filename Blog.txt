Catholic Radicals
They roam a post-apocolyptic wasteland, carrying their cross, following Jesus.

They carry out the acts of mercy:

Feed the hungry ~ planting food
Give water to the thirsty ~ digging wells and cisterns
Clothe the naked ~ gathering fiber and making clothes
Shelter the homeless ~ building simple shelters
Visit the sick ~ bring medicine to those who need it
Visit the imprisoned ~ spend time with the blind and deaf
Bury the dead ~ both bodies and corporations
Instruct the ignorant ~ teach the ways of Christ to the blind and deaf
To counsel the doubtful ~ bring peace to those who find the cross too heavy
Admonish sinners ~ prophecy to the blind and the deaf
Bear patiently those who wrong us ~ leave when they are not wanted
Forgive offenses ~ hold no grudges
Comfort the afflicted ~ show kindness to the blind and the deaf
Pray for the living and the dead ~ praying without ceasing

The blind and the deaf are many, Catholic Radicals walk in their world, even as they reject it to follow Christ.

Their play is to dismantle the trappings of sin: breaking up highways, tearing down railroads, dismantling buildings, slashing tires, and running signal jammers.

Their work is to move from place to place, caring for the animals, and tending to the garden of the earth.

Their intellectual pursuits are to save what is good from amongst the deaf and blind, and rebuild in a way that is centered on Christ.

They love to explore, their scouts are always on the move. And one day soon, they will carry their crosses to other planets. For the acts of mercy are for all of God's creation.

I have an idea for a character:

They have a smartphone, but they treat it like a joke.

It's never on.

They say: "let me show you this cool pic of a cat"

They pull out the phone, and a dry erase marker, and literally draw a picture of a cat on the dead screen of the phone.

They say: "let me play this cool new song for you"

And they pull out the phone, pretend to press some buttons, and just start singing.

They ask for your number, and again, just write it on the screen with the dry erase marker. Anyone who asks them for their number, just gets a random series of digits. Could be "1" could be "5841397453188452"

When they get bored in a conversation, they make a ringing noise, pull out the phone, look at it, and say "I really got to get this" then just put the phone back in their pocket and walk away.

They want to show you a video, they give the dead phone to you, and then just start to act out the video.

2024.02.20 Built on Sin
Insofar as Capitalism as an economic system makes use of profit as a motive, and maintains a free market, relying on the greed of the particpants to self regulate the market: then it is a system built on sin.

The diabolic influences in Capitalistic systems are fairly obvious, when considering it's typical progression towards centralization, preferential treatment for monoliths, and abject disregard for individuals and families.

In our present (2024, USA) situation, this diabolical influence can be seen clearly at work in large, multi-national corporations. 

However, as these entities are not families, and are not individuals, they cannot own property in accordance with the dictates of natural law. 

Therefore, it is impossible to steal from Walmart, or Amazon, or Google, since everything thev have, has no true owner, at least not yet.

Going back to natural law, it is not right to steal, unless something is owed to you in justice (in this case, meaning absolute necessity).

Thus we can look at something like the Landless Worker Movement, which cannot only be just, but spiritually salutary, as long as those with great need, are taking property that is legally owned by a corporation, as they cannot own it in actual fact.

It becomes an act of rectifying an evil. Property belonging to a No-one, becomes the property of a family based tribe.

But that highlights the problem: it is very difficult to appropriate property from the beloved son of the state. The state cares not whether itself, or large corporations, are legitimate or neutral, let alone good.

It is not easy to purge evil from our midst. It will require blood, sweat, and tears. But Christ leads the way, we will carry the cross of large corporations, and be crucified upon the hill of government.
